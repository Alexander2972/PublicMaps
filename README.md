Public Maps
==============

# Intent

This repo contains all non-community submitted maps that are publicly available and used on OCC. We are partnered with [ResourcePile](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/), which distributes many of these maps, where we provide our fixes and updates to ensure compatibility with the currently maintained version of [PGM](https://github.com/PGMDev/PGM).

# Licensing

Each map in this repo contains either a LICENSE.txt or a NOTICE.txt in its folder. While a significant amount of these maps are available under the [CC BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license, this does not apply to every map. If you intend to use any of these maps for your own purposes, please review its respective license/notice; when in doubt, contact the respective map author(s).
